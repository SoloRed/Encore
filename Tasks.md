## Every single task must be done as soon as possible, we're not willing to wait over 2-3 months for a server.
## Tasks prioritezed and must be done as 1,2,3.. and so on.
## A detailed changelog about every script is required in their changelog.txt files for every single script
## Version updating required
## Clean coding required ( That means everything must be understandable for the rest of the team not only for yourselves )
## In case stucked on working and couldn't find a solution for something do not hesitate and ask for help from the rest of the team, no one is gonna laugh, judge or anything else on you.
